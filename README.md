# Simple-Currency-Converter
Project from 'JavaScript for Beginners' course by Hyperskill

## What I've learned
- creating objects;
- creating arrays from objects (`Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`);
- creating functions which handle forLoops, if/else and switch statements.

It's a console program, so here is no GUI.
